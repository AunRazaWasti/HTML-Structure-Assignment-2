<h1> The Story in the Book </h1>
<h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
<p>
Molly had been staring out her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <em>Nature, New Scientist,</em> and all the other<br>
Scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she
<br> spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
<br><br>
She had spent the last the years in this room,sitting under a poster with an Ocsar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have
<br>nothing better to do</q>. A although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the
secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid"> DNA </abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement. Molly <br>
<em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
